		<h1>Our Family
			<span>45 years of spreading knowledge</span></h1>
			<img src="images/1%202.jpg" alt="" class="ar">
		<p>Our journey began in 1971 with two brothers, Shantilal Furia and Hasmukh Furia, whose experience in retail and wholesale of educational books and deep personal interest in the field of education led to the inception of an independent publishing house called Jeevandeep Prakashan. Soon after, their younger brother Harish Furia, with an educational background in printing technology and an experience of running a printing press, joined them to take the business forward.</p>
 
<p>The 90s heralded the beginning of a new, younger wave in the business when Parin Furia joined the company in early 1990. After completing his MBA education, Jeet Furia became the youngest to join the family business in 2008.</p>
